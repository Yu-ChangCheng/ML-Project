# Machine Learning for Multivariate Time Series Data Analysis

## Machine Learning for Trading Projects
The projects mainly involved using Decision Tree/ Random Forest model to predict stock prices. 
Due to GA Tech policy, we are not allowed to share any code on public, if interested, please send email at ycheng345@gatech.edu for inquiry. 


## VAR Model 
To run the model just download the whole folder and change the data source path name in the VAR.py to train and test the model
The projects mainly involved using VAR model to predict solar radiation

## LSTM Model 
To run the model just download the whole folder and change the data source path name in the Sum_all_csv_in_this_file_and_arrange.py and it will generate a training data set and then we can run Main.py to train and test the model
